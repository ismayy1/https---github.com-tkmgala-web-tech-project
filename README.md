# Continuous-feedback-application

Team component: Roxana Balan, Vanessa Angheluta, Ismayyl Atagarryyev

The application will let you sign up as a professor or as a student. After sign up, the user can log in in the future with the credentials.
For students: the page will display a form which requires the code for the activity. 
If the input is incorrect, the form will display a message stating so and ask to reinput the code. Otherwise, it will load the activity. 
The four reaction buttons, a button to leave the activity and the activity screen will all be displayed on the page. For professors: upon loading in, 
the page will display two options â€“ viewing the feedback from past activities and the option to create a new activity. When choosing the first one, a list of past 
activities will be displayed and upon selecting an activity, a list of the reactions and their timestamps will be shown, as well as the total of each reaction at the 
top of the screen. When clicking on the time stamp, the recording of the activity will start playing five seconds before the reaction was given. When creating a new activity, 
an access code will be generated for the professor to share with their class. The user can view all of the reactions in real time, while they are presenting.
